\description{
With this app you can compute your weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify underweight, overweight and obesity in adults.  A high BMI can be an indicator of high body fatness. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual.      
If you fill out your gender, weight and height, the app computes your BMI and displays whether it is on average, above average or below average.
}

\usage{
The formula for computing the BMI is weight(kg)/height(m)^2
}

\examples{
## Male, 180 cm height, 75 kg weight
BMI <- 75/(1.8^2) = 23.2 ##Average BMI, perfect!
